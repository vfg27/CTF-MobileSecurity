## CTF-MobileSecurity
 The three primary areas of this project's Capture the Flag (CTF) 
challenges are Application Development (AppDev), Exploitation, and 
Reversing. Every challenge aims to improve practical cybersecurity 
abilities by having participants solve different security or reverse 
engineering difficulties.

 • Examine the given code, application, or binary to learn about its 
architecture and features.

 • Determine any weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could be exploited, 
including inadequate encryption or incorrect input validation.

 • Create tools or programs to take advantage of these vulnerabilities by 
using strategies including protocol manipulation, injection assaults, and 
buffer overflows.

 • Reverse engineer algorithms or binaries to get private information 
back, decipher passwords, or comprehend intricate encryption 
patterns.

 • Write code to illustrate the vulnerabilities discovered in bespoke 
payloads, exploits, or apps.

 • Test exploits in a supervised setting to guarantee secure execution 
and data gathering.

 • Capture flags are indicators that the challenge was successfully 
exploited or the code was reversed.

 • Keep track of your conclusions, tactics, and actions for every obstacle.
